## The problem
I want a Donut graph, that can display any percentage, on any background.

Using CSS it is quite easy to get a Donut graph displaying such as in this pen https://codepen.io/MikitaLisavets/pen/PqEwvV.
![alt MikitaLisavets codepen unedited](README/codepen1.jpg?raw=true "MikitaLisavets codepen unedited")

Buuuuut if we change the background we can see the trick that was used 

![alt MikitaLisavets codepen edited](README/codepen2.jpg?raw=true "MikitaLisavets codepen edited")

As you can see there is a circle being drawn over the graph, here is the the graph without the circle on top
![alt MikitaLisavets codepen revealed](README/codepen3.jpg?raw=true "MikitaLisavets codepen revealed")

So the requirements:
[ ] Donut Graph
[ ] Display any percentage
[ ] Transparent center
[ ] Work in React

P.S. no npm package so you will have to copy pasta
